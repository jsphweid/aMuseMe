            The whole point of this is to stimulate creativity. Just go. Don't think. Use your
            intuition. Who cares what you write? You can always change it later. Just write
            something!

            Get your ideas down quickly. This is not an editor. This is designed solely to get 
            stuff of paper quickly (metaphorically speaking). Once you get your ideas down, you
            can easily copy/paste your work away or use export options.

            By default, everything you type is saved, even when you exit. You can delete a session
            at any time during the session or later if you are logged in or have your key.
